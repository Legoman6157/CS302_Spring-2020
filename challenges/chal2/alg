What I need to do:
	-Given an unsorted list of integers, find the pair with the smallest difference.

How to go about it:
	-Sort all of the integers, then get all of the pairs.
		-I could do this by keeping a variable for keeping track of the smallest pair difference.
		-This way also ensures that I'll find it because a sorted order means the smallest
			possible difference between any two neighboring numbers.
